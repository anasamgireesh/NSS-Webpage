                    The National Service Scheme (NSS) is a mandatory and integral part of the academic curriculum at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT-T).
                    It is designed to instill social responsibility and community engagement in students. NSS encourages active participation in community development, enriching academic knowledge and fostering a positive contribution to society.
                    NSS at NIT-T is actively involved in the upliftment of surrounding villages, promoting government initiatives like <b>Jal Shakthi, Ek Bharath Shrestha Bharath, and Swachh Bharath</b>. Additionally, the NSS unit conducts awareness sessions on personal hygiene, benefiting the community's overall well-being.
                    The NSS NIT-T unit has adopted several villages, including <b>Thirunedungulam, Arasangudi, Vaalavanthaankottai, Pathalaipatti, and Thondaimanpatti</b>. Volunteers regularly dedicate time to teach children at REC middle school on campus.
                    The unit ensures that the adopted villages receive necessary support, showcasing a dedication to community development. Integrating academic learning with practical community involvement, NSS at NIT-T aims to cultivate social consciousness and empathy among students.
                    By engaging consistently with adopted villages and actively participating in government initiatives, NSS strives to contribute to society's holistic development and envision a brighter future.
